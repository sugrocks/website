                            Cartoon Network stopped using their old system to manage their video catalog and are now exclusively using the new video-data api, the same one as the mobile app.<br/>
                            This means that we can't juste "guess" the episodes IDs (which was just a number) since they now use hashes (long string of "random" chars that we can't just guess).<br/>
                            Until we can fully document all the new system, we can't be sure if there's a way to find "non-active" content.<br/>
                            CTOON's preview platform will be updated in March to support the app data but only for what we can actually see.<br/>
                            <br/>
                            If you know how to get the new data or have some hints, feel free to drop me a tweet/DM (@sugrocks or @CTOONnet), send an email (kdy@airmail.cc) or use Discord (Kody#1337).
